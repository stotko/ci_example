# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the project.

## Reporting issues

If you discover a bug or want to propose a new feature or enhancement to the code or documentation, please check whether the problem has already been reported in the [Issues](https://github.com/stotko/ci_example/issues).

If not, open a new issue and state the problem. Please provide a clear summary of the problem, what behavior you have expected and what behavior you have actually observed. If possible, create a *Minimal Reproducable Example* that demonstrates the problem.


## Submitting Changes

We also highly welcome code contributions via pull requests.

To create and submit your changes, follow the standard *Fork & Pull Request Workflow*:

1. Fork the project and switch to a new suitably named branch.
2. Create one or more commits that reflect the changes you have made. Each commit should be self-contained, atomic and buildable. Therefore, split multiple features into different commits and include fixups in the related commit instead of creating a new one. If you add new functionality, please also add related tests.
3. Test the changes on your local machine. For this, the provided scripts will help you to build the code and run the unit tests. See the [README](https://github.com/stotko/ci_example/blob/master/README.md) for details.
4. Push the branch to your fork.
5. Open a new pull request and summarize the problem and your solution. If there is a related issue, please mention it too.
